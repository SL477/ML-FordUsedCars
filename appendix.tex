\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bagging – using sampling with replacement from the data to create artificial training data (bootstrap samples)
	\item Bayesian Optimisation – a function used to run through an array of different hyperparameters for a machine learning model
	\item BFGS - (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-Newton algorithm) a second order derivative used to help optimise linear regression. [5] (paraphrased)
	\item Decision Tree Regression – splits the data into distinct regions with the region’s mean being the response to a prediction [2] (paraphrased)
	\item Hyperparameter – a parameter of the machine learning model (so named as machine learning models are used to find the parameters of a model)
	\item Lasso Regression – Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. Tries to eliminate as many features as possible when performing the regression to have as sparse a model as possible [3]
	\item Linear Regression: an algorithm which attempts to fit an equation of the form Y = wX + c to the data so that its error to the true value is minimised as far as possible
	\item Normalised: the data is shifted so that its mean is zero and rescaled to move its standard deviation to 1. I am excluding the zero/one categorical columns from this, as it doesn’t make sense to include them.
	\item Random Forest Regression – a collection of decision tree regressors (hence the forest) that behaves as a single model as the average prediction is returned from the collection of decision tree results. Each individual tree is trained using “bagging and random features” [1]. A random subset of features is given to each tree.
	\item Ridge Regression – allows for models where the number of features is greater than the number of predictors and allows interactions between features. “Adds just enough bias to make the estimates reasonably reliable” [4] (paraphrased and directly quoted) 
\end{itemize}
