# ML-FordUsedCars
 Ford Used Cars Data Linear Regression versus Decision Tree Regression

## Required Software
| Name | Version |
| ---- | ------- |
| MATLAB | 9.10 |
| Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox | 12.1 |

## Setup
1. Create folder data
2. Download Ford.csv from: https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes?select=ford.csv and save into the folder data
3. Open MatLab and run main.m

Alternative for steps 1 & 2, on Linux and maybe Macs:
1. Setup Kaggle API using the instructions [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)
2. Run the command:

```bash
bash getData.sh
```

Then run step 3

### LaTex
Install from [here](https://miktex.org/download). Then open in TeXworks and run typeset.

## To work out required files use:

```MATLAB
[fileList, packageList] = matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts("main.m")
```

From https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.codetools.requiredfilesandproducts.html

## Running the models (main)
Download the data to the folder data, then run main.m to run both models off against each other and generate the majority of the graphs:

*Histograms of the data*
![Scatterplots](/img/ScatterPlots.jpg)
*Scatterplots of the data against the price*
![Linear Regression residuals](/img/LRResiduals.jpg)
*Linear Regression residuals*
![Random Forest residuals](/img/RFResiduals.jpg)
*Random Forest residuals*


## Supplementary code
### Feature Importance
This is used to see which features the models use (needs main to have run first).

![LR Feature importance](/img/LRFeatureImportance.jpg)
*Linear Regression's coefficients*
![RF Feature importance](/img/RFFeatureImportance.jpg)
*Relative feature importance for Random Forest*

### KFoldLR/KFoldRF
These were used to experiment with using K-Fold validation on the models (needs main to have run first). These require the function in predictCombinedMdl to run.

### OptimiseRandomForest/OptimiseLinearRegression
These were used to find the best hyperparameters for the relevant models (needs main to have run first).
