	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a
random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization

error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization

error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre-

lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare

favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna-
tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error,
strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in

the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to

regression.},

In addition to thermal scanning mechanisms, chest imaging examinations provide valuable insights to the detection of this virus, diagnosis and prognosis of the infections. Though Chest {CT} and Chest X-ray imaging are common in the clinical protocols of {COVID}-19 management, the latter is highly preferred, attributed to its simple image acquisition procedure and mobility of the imaging mechanism.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to enhance the diagnostic values of these images for improved clinical outcomes.

	shorttitle = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning},
	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra. This Second Edition features new chapters on deep learning, survival analysis, and multiple testing, as well as expanded treatments of naïve Bayes, generalized linear models, Bayesian additive regression trees, and matrix completion. R code has been updated throughout to ensure compatibility.},
